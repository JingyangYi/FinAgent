### **Step 2: Analyst Comments**  

- **Profitability Surge**: Net income jumped **64.2% YoY** ($10.4B â†’ $17.1B), driven by strong revenue growth (especially in services, +11.3%) and improved operating leverage (operating income up **20.2%**).  
- **OCI Volatility**: Other Comprehensive Income worsened YoY (-$558M â†’ -$880M), primarily due to foreign currency translation swings and unrealized losses on debt securities, highlighting external market risks.  
- **Capital Return Opaque**: No explicit data on buybacks, dividends, or equity changes, but the absence of disclosures suggests Amazon continues prioritizing reinvestment over shareholder returns.

### **Step 2: Analyst Comments**  

- **Strong Operating Cash Flow Growth**: Operating cash flow increased **14.9% YoY** to $113.9B, driven by higher net income (+75% YoY) and improved working capital management (e.g., slower inventory growth). This underscores Amazonâ€™s core profitability resilience despite macroeconomic pressures.  
- **Aggressive CapEx Expansion**: Investing cash outflows surged **105% YoY** to $106.3B, with CapEx nearly doubling to $93.1B, likely reflecting heavy investments in infrastructure (e.g., AWS, logistics). This signals confidence in long-term growth but pressures near-term free cash flow (-54.5% YoY).  
- **Liquidity Tightens Despite Strong Operations**: Despite robust operating cash flow, the net cash position **declined by $3.4B** (vs. a +$23.6B increase in 2024), as aggressive investments and debt repayments ($10.6B outflow in financing) offset operational gains.
